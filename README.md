This is a collection of tools for working with GraphViz in python.   

Contained in this repository are:   
* `GraphVizDemo.ipynb` : A notebook compilation of examples, many are agregated from other examples found in the GraphViz documentation or StackOverflow answers though I've made modifications to quite a few to add extra styling. I tried to cite the original source but there are gaps.  
* `GraphViz_Tool.ipynb` : A quick and dirty tool for a) plotting dotGraphs pasted into a cell. b) plotting dotGraphs contained in external files.  
* `GraqphVizParser.ipynb` : A parser for dot files. Generates an AST structure.
